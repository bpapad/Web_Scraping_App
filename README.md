# Forum-Fetcher-Sorter
A Java GUI form which parses a specific HTML page and fetches the required by the user data

Java (13)

To run the program just execute the poeui2.jar on cmd or open the Main.java from any Java compiler.

A GUI form in which the user chooses a character class and evolution (ascendancy) and then the program parses the html code of the resulting forum page (https://www.pathofexile.com/forum), loads, sorts and prints the top 10 most popular (viewed) buildguides regarding the users earlier choice.

Took inspiration from my favourite game and translated it in Java.
